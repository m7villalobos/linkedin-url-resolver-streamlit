**Description:**  
This tool allows you to paste your LinkedIn post containing shortened URLs (e.g. lnkd.in) and automatically resolves them into their original full links, saving you time and effort when sharing or analyzing posts.

**Author:** [Miguel Ángel Villalobos García](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m7villalobos/)  

**How it works:**  
1. Paste your LinkedIn post with shortened links.  
2. Click on the "Resolve URLs" button.  
3. The tool will replace all shortened LinkedIn URLs with their original, fully expanded URLs.  
4. You can then copy the updated text to your clipboard for easy sharing or further editing.
